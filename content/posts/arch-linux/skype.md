# Skype

5 July 2018

The best option turned out to be skypeforlinux-stable-bin (AUR)

An interesting solution with Arch users is to run skype through Chromium.

Either with
```
chromium --app=https://web.skype.com
```
or by installing the extension from the chrome web store.

This is amazing, considering that skypeforlinux-stable-bin-8.25.0.5-1 requires 216.45 MB, but it doesn't have the full feature set available with Skype normally so I ended up preferring the main package.
